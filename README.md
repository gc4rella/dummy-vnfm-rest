# Dummy VNFManager Rest
The Dummy-VNFManager-Rest imitates the behaviour of a real VNFManager. For the communication with the NFVO it uses the NFVO's Rest API.  
If you use the Dummy-VNFManager-Rest for deploying a network service it will not create any resources. 
When the NFVO sends commands to the Dummy-VNFManager-Rest, it will answer as if it executed them although it actually did not. 
In this way Openbaton can be tested without actually deploying anything. 

## Technical Requirements

In order to execute the dummy-vnfm-rest, you need to have a running and configured NFVO. 

## How to install the Dummy VNFManager Rest from source code

Git clone the project into the /opt/openbaton directory (you may need to be logged in as root user, unless you change the permissions on the /opt/openbaton folder): 

```bash
mkdir /opt/openbaton
git clone https://github.com/openbaton/dummy-vnfm-rest.git
```

And Execute 
```bash
cd /opt/openbaton/dummy-vnfm-rest; ./dummy-vnfm.sh compile
```
to compile it. 

## How to use the Dummy VNFManager Rest

To start the Dummy-VNFM-Rest execute
 ```bash
 cd /opt/openbaton/dummy-vnfm-rest;./dummy-vnfm.sh start
 ```

This will create a new screen window which you can access using *screen -x openbaton*.  

If you want to run the Dummy VNFManager Rest on another machine than on which the NFVO is running you first have to configure it. 
The problem is that the endpoint which is sent to the NFVO is by default *http://localhost:8080*, but if the VNFManager runs on another machine 
the NFVO will not be able to reach the VNFManager because the endpoint does not specify the manager's correct location. 
To change that you have to adapt the endpoint in the **conf.properties** file in the resource folder of the VNFManager.  
Furthermore you have to tell the VNFManager where the NFVO is running. This can be done by changing the properties in the **application.properties** file 
which is also located in the project's resource folder.  
You can change the following properties: 

| Property          				| Function       																|
| -------------   		     		| -------------:																|
| server.port                       | The port on which the VNFM will listen for the NFVO's messages. Do not forget to also change the endpoint in conf.properties if you change it. |
| vnfm.rest.nfvoHost  					| The ip address of the machine on which the NFVO is running.               |
| vnfm.rest.nfvoPort  					| The port on which the NFVO is running.               |
| vnfm.rest.nfvoSsl  					| Set this to true if the NFVO uses SSL.                |

Instead of changing the properties directly in the project you can also create an external properties file.  
To do this create the file **/etc/openbaton/dummy-vnfm-rest.properties** and copy the properties of the previously mentioned **application.properties** file into it. 

To use the Dummy-VNFManager-Rest for "deploying" a network service you have to store a VimInstance with type *test* in the NFVO 
and the Virtual Network Function Descriptors used to describe the network service have to define their *endpoint* as *test*. 

## How to extend the Dummy VNFManager Rest

If you want the Dummy VNFManager Rest to behave differently you can change it's behaviour in the DummyRestVNFManager.java class.
In this class all the methods are defined that will be executed by a VNFM while deploying a network service.

## What is Open Baton?

OpenBaton is an open source project providing a comprehensive implementation of the ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO) specification.

Open Baton is a ETSI NFV MANO compliant framework. Open Baton was part of the OpenSDNCore (www.opensdncore.org) project started almost three years ago by Fraunhofer FOKUS with the objective of providing a compliant implementation of the ETSI NFV specification. 

Open Baton is easily extensible. It integrates with OpenStack, and provides a plugin mechanism for supporting additional VIM types. It supports Network Service management either using a generic VNFM or interoperating with VNF-specific VNFM. It uses different mechanisms (REST or PUB/SUB) for interoperating with the VNFMs. It integrates with additional components for the runtime management of a Network Service. For instance, it provides autoscaling and fault management based on monitoring information coming from the the monitoring system available at the NFVI level.
